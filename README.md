# A_Model_To_Identify_Patient_Diagnosed_with_Parkinson-s_Disease_Using_Supervised_Learning

Parkinson's disease is a progressive nervous system disorder that affects movement. 
Symptoms start gradually, sometimes starting with a barely noticeable tremor which commonly causes stiffness or slowing of movement. 
Your speech may become soft or slurred. Parkinson's disease symptoms worsen as your condition progresses over time

Although Parkinson's disease can't be cured, medications might significantly improve your symptoms, so it's better to discover the symptoms earlier, so medications can swiftly begin.

The death rate from Parkinsonâ€™s disease has gradually and steadily increased over the last decade according statista, with reports suggesting that the reason is due to late diagnosis and reluctance of people older than 60 to always do diagnosis check.

I'll be working with a  dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements, Since soft or slurred speech is highly a major early symptom for Parkinson's disease, a nuanced collection of biomedical voice measurements features is what I'll be using to predict if a person has symptoms of Parkinson's disease. 



In this Project, I'll:

1.Prepare the data for machine learning

2.Train a model using Logistic Regression and other Classifier models

3.Measure the accuracy of the model


Building a model to predict which patients have Parkinsons disease (knowing the adverse effects of not detecting the symptoms earlier), every patient that is missed by the model could mean a loss of life.

So I'd want a highly sensitive model that is able to "catch" all of the positive cases (in this case, the positive case is a patient with Parkinson's disease).
